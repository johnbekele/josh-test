# Project Instructions

## Git and GitHub Configuration

**IMPORTANT:** When creating commits, pushing to repositories, or performing any git/GitHub tasks:

- Do NOT include any Claude/AI co-author attribution in commits
- Do NOT add "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or similar lines
- Do NOT use the Claude GitHub profile in any way
- Only use the user's MCP GitHub profile (johnbekele) for all operations
- Claude should NOT appear in the contributor list of any repository

Commit messages should be clean without AI attribution footers.
